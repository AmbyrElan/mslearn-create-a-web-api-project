# Create a Web API with ASP.Net Core controllers

Created an ASP.NET Core web API running on .NET. The web API creates, reads, updates, and deletes pizzas from an in-memory cache.

Learned that creating a web API with ASP.NET Core entails:

- Creating a new application by using the ASP.NET Core Web API template.
- Creating classes that inherit from the ControllerBase class and that contain methods that respond to HTTP requests.
